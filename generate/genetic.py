    The Appropriate Use of Approximate Entropy and Sample Entropy with Short Data Sets
    DOI: 10.1007/s10439-012-0668-3 
    
    Our results demonstrate that both ApEn and SampEn are extremely sensitive to parameter choices, 
    especially for very short data sets, N â‰¤ 200. We suggest using:

         N larger than 200, 
         an m of 2 

    and examine several r values before selecting your parameters.
